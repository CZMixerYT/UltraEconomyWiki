# Welcome!

Thanks for choosing *Ultra Economy*!
After installing you just need to add the ``ultraeconomy.admin`` permission to yourself and execute **/uecon**.

<br />

If you are using BungeeCord, install Ultra Economy there as well and setup MySQL on every Server.
The MySQL Settings can be accessed from */uecon > Settings > MySQL*

<br />

After following these steps the plugin should be fully functional and ready to use!
