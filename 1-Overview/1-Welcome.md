# Welcome!

Thanks for choosing ``Ultra Economy``!
After installing you just need to add the ``ultraeconomy.admin`` permission to yourself and execute **/uecon**.

<br />

If you are running a Network out of multiple Servers, install Ultra Economy also on your BungeeCord & setup MySQL on every Server via the Settings GUI.
The MySQL Settings can be accessed from */uecon > Settings > MySQL*

<br />

After following these steps the plugin should be fully functional and ready to use!
