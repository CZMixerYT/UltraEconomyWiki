# Welcome!

Thanks for choosing *Ultra Economy*!
After installing you just need to add the ``ultraeconomy.admin`` permission to yourself and execute **/uecon**.

<br>

Your players need to have the ``insaneshops.create`` permission to create their own shops. If your players should be allowed to make sell-shops you also have to add the ``insaneshops.create.sellshop`` permission.

<br />

After following these steps the plugin should be fully functional and ready to use!
